# DataStructures-Algorithm
*AdityaSharma*
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Each directory represents a specific topic or data structure along with its corresponding implementation.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or learning resource. Contributions are also welcome if you have any improvements or additional implementations to share.

## Table of Contents

- [Bit Manipulation](./bitmanipulation)
- [Heap Data Structure](./heapDataStructure)
- [Maps-STL](./Maps-STL)

## Bit Manipulation

The `bitmanipulation` directory contains implementations of various algorithms and techniques related to bit manipulation. These algorithms can be used to efficiently manipulate and extract information from binary representations of numbers.

## Heap Data Structure

The `heapDataStructure` directory contains implementations of the heap data structure. Heaps are binary trees that satisfy the heap property, which allows for efficient retrieval of the maximum or minimum element. The directory includes both the implementation of the heap itself and algorithms that utilize the heap.

## Maps-STL

The `Maps-STL` directory contains implementations of data structures and algorithms related to the `map` container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Maps are associative containers that store key-value pairs and provide efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup based on the keys.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply navigate to the respective directory and explore the implementation files. Each directory may contain multiple source code files and a README file that provides more information about the specific topic or data structure.
